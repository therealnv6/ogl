# ogl 
this is just a simple OpenGL voxel renderer using OpenGL and GLFW. Don't expect this to go anywhere, this is just a small playground for me to experiment with certain tools and C++.

# Current Progress 
Haven't been doing much lately, working on other projects. Here is what it has right now:
* Simple OpenGL abstraction layer (just veryyyy small functions that call the underlying OpenGL calls)
* Simple camera system 
* Implemented ImGui, framework.hpp makes it easier to use as well.
* Implemented EnTT, yay.
* Simple voxel raymarching algorithm.

# Todo
I still have to do A LOT. We're not actually rendering anything except for a single cube.
